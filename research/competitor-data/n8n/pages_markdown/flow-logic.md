Description: How to represent logic in n8n workflows.
# Flow logic[#](#flow-logic "Permanent link")

n8n allows you to represent complex logic in your workflows.

This section covers:

* [Splitting with conditionals](/flow-logic/splitting/)
* [Merging data](/flow-logic/merging/)
* [Looping](/flow-logic/looping/)
* [Waiting](/flow-logic/waiting/)
* [Sub-workflows](/flow-logic/subworkflows/)
* [Error handling](/flow-logic/error-handling/)
* [Execution order in multi-branch workflows](/flow-logic/execution-order/)

You need some understanding of [Data](../data/) in n8n, including [Data structure](../data/data-structure/) and [Data flow within nodes](../data/data-structure/#how-data-flows-within-nodes).

When building your logic, you'll use n8n's [Core nodes](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/), including:

* Splitting: [IF](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) and [Switch](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/).
* Merging: [Merge](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/), [Compare Datasets](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/), and [Code](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).
* Looping: [IF](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) and [Loop Over Items](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/).
* Waiting: [Wait](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/).
* Creating sub-workflows: [Execute Workflow](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) and [Execute Workflow Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/).
* Error handling: [Stop And Error](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) and [Error Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/).
