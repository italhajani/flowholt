Description: Customize the n8n container to work with self signed certificates when connecting to services.
# Configure n8n to use your own certificate authority or self-signed certificate[#](#configure-n8n-to-use-your-own-certificate-authority-or-self-signed-certificate "Permanent link")

You can add your own certificate authority (CA) or self-signed certificate to n8n. This means you are able to trust a certain SSL certificate instead of trusting all invalid certificates, which is a potential security risk.

Added in version 1.42.0

This feature is available in version 1.42.0 and above.

To use this feature you need to place your certificates in a folder and mount the folder to `/opt/custom-certificates` in the container. The external path that you map to `/opt/custom-certificates` must be writable by the container.

## Docker[#](#docker "Permanent link")

The examples below assume you have a folder called `pki` that contains your certificates in either the directory you run the command from or next to your docker compose file.

### Docker CLI[#](#docker-cli "Permanent link")

When using the CLI you can use the `-v` flag from the command line:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 ``` | ``` docker run -it --rm \  --name n8n \  -p 5678:5678 \  -v ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates \  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n ``` |

### Docker Compose[#](#docker-compose "Permanent link")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ``` | ``` name: n8n services:     n8n:         volumes:             - ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates         container_name: n8n         ports:             - 5678:5678         image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n ``` |

You should also give the right permissions to the imported certs. You can do this once the container is running (assuming n8n as the container name):

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` docker exec --user 0 n8n chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/custom-certificates ``` |

## Certificate requirements for Custom Trust Store[#](#certificate-requirements-for-custom-trust-store "Permanent link")

Supported certificate types:

* Root CA Certificates: these are certificates from Certificate Authorities that sign other certificates. Trust these to accept all certificates signed by that CA.
* Self-Signed Certificates: certificates that servers create and sign themselves. Trust these to accept connections to that specific server only.

You must use PEM format:

* Text-based format with BEGIN/END markers
* Supported file extensions: `.pem`, `.crt`, `.cer`
* Contains the public certificate (no private key needed)

For example:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- MIIDXTCCAkWgAwIBAgIJAKoK/heBjcOuMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBBQUAMEUxCzAJBgNV [base64 encoded data] -----END CERTIFICATE----- ``` |

The system doesn't accept:

* DER/binary format files
* PKCS#7 (.p7b) files
* PKCS#12 (.pfx, .p12) files
* Private key files
* Convert these formats to PEM before use.
