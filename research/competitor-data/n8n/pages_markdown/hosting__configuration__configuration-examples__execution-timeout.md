Description: Set execution timeouts to determine how long workflows can run.
# Configure workflow timeout settings[#](#configure-workflow-timeout-settings "Permanent link")

A workflow times out and gets canceled after this time (in seconds). If the workflow runs in the main process, a soft timeout happens (takes effect after the current node finishes). If a workflow runs in its own process, n8n attempts a soft timeout first, then kills the process after waiting for a fifth of the given timeout duration.

`EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` default is `-1`. For example, if you want to set the timeout to one hour:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT=3600 ``` |

You can also set maximum execution time (in seconds) for each workflow individually. For example, if you want to set maximum execution time to two hours:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX=7200 ``` |

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/executions/) for more information on these variables.
