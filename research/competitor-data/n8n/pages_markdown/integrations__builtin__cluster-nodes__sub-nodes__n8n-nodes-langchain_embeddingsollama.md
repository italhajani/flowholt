Description: Learn how to use the Embeddings Ollama node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate Embeddings Ollama node into your workflows.
# Embeddings Ollama node[#](#embeddings-ollama-node "Permanent link")

Use the Embeddings Ollama node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Ollama node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/ollama/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.
