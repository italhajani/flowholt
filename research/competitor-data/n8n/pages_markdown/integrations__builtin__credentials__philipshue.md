Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're using the built-in OAuth connection, you don't need to enter an **APP ID**.

If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, you'll need a [Philips Hue developer](https://developers.meethue.com/) account

Create a new remote app on the [Add new Hue Remote API app](https://developers.meethue.com/add-new-hue-remote-api-app/) page.

Use these settings for your app:

* Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and add it as a **Callback URL**.
* Copy the **AppId**, **ClientId**, and **ClientSecret** and enter these in the corresponding fields in n8n.
