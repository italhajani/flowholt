# Reddit credentials[#](#reddit-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Reddit](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.reddit/)

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

Create a [Reddit](https://reddit.com/) account.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Reddit's developer documentation](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/14945211791892-Developer-Platform-Accessing-Reddit-Data) for more information about the service.

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **Client ID**
* A **Client Secret**

Developer program

Reddit's developer program is in a closed beta. The instructions below are for regular Reddit users, not members of the developer platform.

Generate both by creating a [third-party app](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps). Visit the previous link or go to your **profile > Settings > Safety & Privacy > Manage third-party app authorization > are you a developer? create an app**.

Use these settings for your app:

* Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and use it as your app's **redirect uri**.
* The app's client ID displays underneath your app name. Copy that and add it as your n8n **Client ID**.
* Copy the app's **secret** and add it as your n8n **Client Secret**.
