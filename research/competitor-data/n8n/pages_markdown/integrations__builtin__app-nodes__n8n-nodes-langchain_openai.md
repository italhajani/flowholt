Description: Learn how to use the OpenAI node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate OpenAI node into your workflows.
# OpenAI node[#](#openai-node "Permanent link")

Use the OpenAI node to automate work in OpenAI and integrate OpenAI with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of OpenAI features, including creating images and assistants, as well as chatting with models.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the OpenAI node supports and links to more resources.

Previous node versions

The OpenAI node replaces the OpenAI assistant node from version 1.29.0 on.
n8n version 1.117.0 introduces V2 of the OpenAI node that supports the OpenAI Responses API and removes support for the [to-be-deprecated Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/migration).

Credentials

Refer to [OpenAI credentials](../../credentials/openai/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [OpenAI's documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction) for more information about the service.

Refer to [OpenAI's assistants documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works/objects) for more information about how assistants work.

For help dealing with rate limits, refer to [Handling rate limits](../../rate-limits/).

## What to do if your operation isn't supported[#](#what-to-do-if-your-operation-isnt-supported "Permanent link")

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Using tools with OpenAI assistants[#](#using-tools-with-openai-assistants "Permanent link")

Some operations allow you to connect tools. [Tools](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/) act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.

Select the **Tools** connector to browse the available tools and add them.

Once you add a tool connection, the OpenAI node becomes a [root node](../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), allowing it to form a [cluster node](../../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) with the tools [sub-nodes](../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). See [Node types](../../node-types/#cluster-nodes) for more information on cluster nodes and root nodes.
