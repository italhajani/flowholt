### Custom mode[#](#custom-mode "Permanent link")

Enter a custom **Cron Expression** to trigger the poll. Use these values and ranges:

* Seconds: `0` - `59`

* Hours: `0` - `23`
* Day of Month: `1` - `31`
* Months: `0` - `11` (Jan - Dec)
* Day of Week: `0` - `6` (Sun - Sat)

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru). Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Cron Expression** field in n8n.

#### Examples[#](#examples "Permanent link")

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08:30, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` 30 8 4 * * * ``` |

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.

#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression[#](#why-there-are-six-asterisks-in-the-cron-expression "Permanent link")

The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.
