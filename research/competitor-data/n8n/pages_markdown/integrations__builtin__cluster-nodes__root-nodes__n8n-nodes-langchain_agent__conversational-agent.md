Description: Learn how to use the Conversational Agent of the AI Agent node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate the Conversational Agent into your workflows.
# Conversational AI Agent node[#](#conversational-ai-agent-node "Permanent link")

Feature removed

n8n removed this functionality in February 2025.

The Conversational Agent has human-like conversations. It can maintain context, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers. This agent is typically used for building chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems.

The Conversational Agent describes [tools](../../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) in the system prompt and parses JSON responses for tool calls. If your preferred AI model doesn't support tool calling or you're handling simpler interactions, this agent is a good general option. It's more flexible but may be less accurate than the [Tools Agent](../tools-agent/).

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

You can use this agent with the [Chat Trigger](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node. Attach a memory sub-node so that users can have an ongoing conversation with multiple queries. Memory doesn't persist between sessions.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Configure the Conversational Agent using the following parameters.

### Prompt[#](#prompt "Permanent link")

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

Choose from:

* **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
* **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format[#](#require-specific-output-format "Permanent link")

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

* [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
* [Item List Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
* [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Refine the Conversational Agent node's behavior using these options:

### Human Message[#](#human-message "Permanent link")

Tell the agent about the tools it can use and add context to the user's input.

You must include these expressions and variable:

* `{tools}`: A LangChain expression that provides a string of the tools you've connected to the Agent. Provide some context or explanation about who should use the tools and how they should use them.
* `{format_instructions}`: A LangChain expression that provides the schema or format from the output parser node you've connected. Since the instructions themselves are context, you don't need to provide context for this expression.
* `{{input}}`: A LangChain variable containing the user's prompt. This variable populates with the value of the **Prompt** parameter. Provide some context that this is the user's input.

Here's an example of how you might use these strings:

Example:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 ``` | ``` TOOLS ------ Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the user's original question. The tools the human can use are:  {tools}  {format_instructions}  USER'S INPUT -------------------- Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a JSON blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):  {{input}} ``` |

### System Message[#](#system-message "Permanent link")

If you'd like to send a message to the agent before the conversation starts, enter the message you'd like to send.

Use this option to guide the agent's decision-making.

### Max Iterations[#](#max-iterations "Permanent link")

Enter the number of times the model should run to try and generate a good answer from the user's prompt.

Defaults to `10`.

### Return Intermediate Steps[#](#return-intermediate-steps "Permanent link")

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

### Tracing Metadata[#](#tracing-metadata "Permanent link")

Add custom key-value metadata to tracing events for this agent. This is useful for filtering and debugging runs in tracing tools like [LangSmith](../../../../../../advanced-ai/langchain/langsmith/).

Entries with empty keys or values are ignored.

## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples "Permanent link")

Refer to the main AI Agent node's [Templates and examples](../#templates-and-examples) section.

## Common issues[#](#common-issues "Permanent link")

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](../common-issues/).
