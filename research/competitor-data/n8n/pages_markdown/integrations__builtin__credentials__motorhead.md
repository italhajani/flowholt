You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Motorhead](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymotorhead/)

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* API key

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Motorhead's API documentation](https://docs.getmetal.io/rest-api/introduction) for more information about the service.

## Using API key[#](#using-api-key "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Motorhead](https://www.metal.ai/) account and:

* Your **Host** URL
* An **API Key**
* A **Client ID**

To set it up, you'll generate an API key:

1. If you're self-hosting Motorhead, update the **Host** URL to match your Motorhead URL.
2. In Motorhead, go to **Settings > Organization**.
3. In the **API Keys** section, select **Create**.
4. Enter a **Name** for your API Key, like `n8n integration`.
5. Select **Generate**.
6. Copy the **apiKey** and enter it in your n8n credential.
7. Return to the API key list.
8. Copy the **clientID** for the key and enter it as the **Client ID** in your n8n credential.

Refer to [Generate an API key](https://docs.getmetal.io/guides/misc-get-keys) for more information.
