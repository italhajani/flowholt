# Facebook Trigger Ad Account object[#](#facebook-trigger-ad-account-object "Permanent link")

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).

Examples and templates

## Trigger configuration[#](#trigger-configuration "Permanent link")

To configure the trigger with this Object:

1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).
2. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/) documentation for more information.
3. Select **Ad Account** as the **Object**.
4. **Field Names or IDs**: By default, the node will trigger on all the available Ad Account events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
   * **In Process Ad Objects**: Notifies you when a campaign, ad set, or ad exits the `IN_PROCESS` status. Refer to Meta's [Post-processing for Ad Creation and Edits](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/using-the-api/post-processing/) for more information.
   * **With Issues Ad Objects**: Notifies you when a campaign, ad set, or ad under the ad account receives the `WITH_ISSUES` status.
5. In **Options**, turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. This Object type fails without the option enabled.
