Description: Install and run n8n using Docker Compose
# Docker-Compose[#](#docker-compose "Permanent link")

These instructions cover how to run n8n on a Linux server using Docker Compose.

If you have already installed Docker and Docker-Compose, then you can start with [step 3](#3-dns-setup).

You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the [n8n-hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting).

Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

* Setting up and configuring servers and containers
* Managing application resources and scaling
* Securing servers and applications
* Configuring n8n

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

Stable and Beta versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `stable` version is for production use. `beta` is the most recent release. The `beta` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `stable`: 2.15.0
Current `beta`: 2.16.0

## 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose[#](#1-install-docker-and-docker-compose "Permanent link")

The way that you install Docker and Docker Compose depends on your Linux distribution. You can find specific instructions for each component in the links below:

* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)

After following the installation instructions, verify that Docker and Docker Compose are available by typing:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` docker --version docker compose version ``` |

## 2. Optional: Non-root user access[#](#2-optional-non-root-user-access "Permanent link")

You can optionally grant access to run Docker without the `sudo` command.

To grant access to the user that you're currently logged in with (assuming they have `sudo` access), run:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 ``` | ``` sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER} # Register the `docker` group membership with current session without changing your primary group exec sg docker newgrp ``` |

To grant access to a different user, type the following, substituting `<USER_TO_RUN_DOCKER>` with the appropriate username:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo usermod -aG docker <USER_TO_RUN_DOCKER> ``` |

You will need to run `exec sg docker newgrp` from any of that user's existing sessions for it to access the new group permissions.

You can verify that your current session recognizes the `docker` group by typing:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` groups ``` |

## 3. DNS setup[#](#3-dns-setup "Permanent link")

To host n8n online or on a network, create a dedicated subdomain pointed at your server.

Add an A record to route the subdomain accordingly:

| Record type | Name | Destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | `n8n` (or your desired subdomain) | `<your_server_IP_address>` |

## 4. Create an `.env` file[#](#4-create-an-env-file "Permanent link")

Create a project directory to store your n8n environment configuration and Docker Compose files and navigate inside:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` mkdir n8n-compose cd n8n-compose ``` |

Inside the `n8n-compose` directory, create an `.env` file to customize your n8n instance's details. Change it to match your own information:

| .env file | |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` # DOMAIN_NAME and SUBDOMAIN together determine where n8n will be reachable from # The top level domain to serve from DOMAIN_NAME=example.com  # The subdomain to serve from SUBDOMAIN=n8n  # The above example serve n8n at: https://n8n.example.com  # Optional timezone to set which gets used by Cron and other scheduling nodes # New York is the default value if not set GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin  # The email address to use for the TLS/SSL certificate creation SSL_EMAIL=user@example.com ``` |

## 5. Create local files directory[#](#5-create-local-files-directory "Permanent link")

Inside your project directory, create a directory called `local-files` for sharing files between the n8n instance and the host system (for example, using the [Read/Write Files from Disk node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)):

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` mkdir local-files ``` |

The Docker Compose file below can automatically create this directory, but doing it manually ensures that it's created with the right ownership and permissions.

## 6. Create Docker Compose file[#](#6-create-docker-compose-file "Permanent link")

Create a `compose.yaml` file. Paste the following in the file:

| compose.yaml file | |
| --- | --- |
| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 ``` | ``` services:   traefik:     image: "traefik"     restart: always     command:       - "--api.insecure=true"       - "--providers.docker=true"       - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"       - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"       - "--entrypoints.web.http.redirections.entryPoint.to=websecure"       - "--entrypoints.web.http.redirections.entrypoint.scheme=https"       - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"       - "--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.tlschallenge=true"       - "--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.email=${SSL_EMAIL}"       - "--certificatesresolvers.mytlschallenge.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"     ports:       - "80:80"       - "443:443"     volumes:       - traefik_data:/letsencrypt       - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro    n8n:     image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n     restart: always     ports:       - "127.0.0.1:5678:5678"     labels:       - traefik.enable=true       - traefik.http.routers.n8n.rule=Host(`${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}`)       - traefik.http.routers.n8n.tls=true       - traefik.http.routers.n8n.entrypoints=web,websecure       - traefik.http.routers.n8n.tls.certresolver=mytlschallenge       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.SSLRedirect=true       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSSeconds=315360000       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.browserXSSFilter=true       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.contentTypeNosniff=true       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.forceSTSHeader=true       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.SSLHost=${DOMAIN_NAME}       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSIncludeSubdomains=true       - traefik.http.middlewares.n8n.headers.STSPreload=true       - traefik.http.routers.n8n.middlewares=n8n@docker     environment:       - N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true       - N8N_HOST=${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}       - N8N_PORT=5678       - N8N_PROTOCOL=https         - NODE_ENV=production       - WEBHOOK_URL=https://${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}/       - GENERIC_TIMEZONE=${GENERIC_TIMEZONE}       - TZ=${GENERIC_TIMEZONE}     volumes:       - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n       - ./local-files:/files  volumes:   n8n_data:   traefik_data: ``` |

The Docker Compose file above configures two containers: one for n8n, and one to run [traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik), an application proxy to manage TLS/SSL certificates and handle routing.

It also creates and mounts two [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) and mounts the `local-files` directory you created earlier:

| Name | Type | Container mount | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `n8n_data` | [Volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) | `/home/node/.n8n` | Where n8n saves its SQLite database file and encryption key. |
| `traefik_data` | [Volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) | `/letsencrypt` | Where traefik saves TLS/SSL certificate data. |
| `./local-files` | [Bind](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/) | `/files` | A local directory shared between the n8n instance and host. In n8n, use the `/files` path to read from and write to this directory. |

## 7. Start Docker Compose[#](#7-start-docker-compose "Permanent link")

Start n8n by typing:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo docker compose up -d ``` |

To stop the containers, type:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` sudo docker compose stop ``` |

## 8. Done[#](#8-done "Permanent link")

You can now reach n8n using the subdomain + domain combination you defined in your `.env` file configuration. The above example would result in `https://n8n.example.com`.

n8n is only accessible using secure HTTPS, not over plain HTTP.

If you have trouble reaching your instance, check your server's firewall settings and your DNS configuration.
