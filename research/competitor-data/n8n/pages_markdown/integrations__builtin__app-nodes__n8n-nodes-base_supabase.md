On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Supabase node supports and links to more resources.

This node can be used as an AI tool

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

## Using custom schemas[#](#using-custom-schemas "Permanent link")

By default, the Supabase node only fetches the `public` schema. To fetch [custom schemas](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/using-custom-schemas), enable **Use Custom Schema**.

In the new **Schema** field, provide the custom schema the Supabase node should use.

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.
