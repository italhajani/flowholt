Description: Learn how to use the TheHive 5 Trigger node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate TheHive 5 Trigger node into your workflows.
# TheHive 5 Trigger node[#](#thehive-5-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Use the TheHive 5 Trigger node to respond to events in [TheHive](https://strangebee.com/thehive/) and integrate TheHive with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of TheHive events, including alerts, cases, comments, pages, and tasks.

On this page, you'll find a list of events the TheHive5 Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.

TheHive and TheHive 5

n8n provides two nodes for TheHive. Use this node (TheHive 5 Trigger) if you want to use TheHive's version 5 API. If you want to use version 3 or 4, use [TheHive Trigger](../n8n-nodes-base.thehivetrigger/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [TheHive 5 Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/thehive-5-trigger/) page.

## Configure a webhook in TheHive[#](#configure-a-webhook-in-thehive "Permanent link")

To configure the webhook for your TheHive instance:

1. Copy the testing and production webhook URLs from TheHive Trigger node.
2. Add the following lines to the `application.conf` file. This is TheHive configuration file:

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ``` | ``` notification.webhook.endpoints = [ 	{ 		name: TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME 		url: TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL 		version: 1 		wsConfig: {} 		includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"] 		excludedTheHiveOrganisations: [] 	}, 	{ 		name: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME 		url: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL 		version: 1 		wsConfig: {} 		includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"] 		excludedTheHiveOrganisations: [] 	} ] ``` |
3. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the URLs you copied in the previous step.
4. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME` with your preferred endpoint names.
5. Replace `ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.
6. Execute the following cURL command to enable notifications:

   |  |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ``` | ``` curl -XPUT -uTHEHIVE_USERNAME:THEHIVE_PASSWORD -H 'Content-type: application/json' THEHIVE_URL/api/config/organisation/notification -d ' { 	"value": [ 		{ 		"delegate": false, 		"trigger": { "name": "AnyEvent"}, 		"notifier": { "name": "webhook", "endpoint": "TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME" } 		}, 		{ 		"delegate": false, 		"trigger": { "name": "AnyEvent"}, 		"notifier": { "name": "webhook", "endpoint": "PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME" } 		} 	] }' ``` |
