## Using basic auth[#](#using-basic-auth "Permanent link")

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports basic authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

* The **Password** that goes with that username

## Using JWT auth[#](#using-jwt-auth "Permanent link")

[**JWT Auth**](https://jwt.io/introduction/) is a method of authentication that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to digitally sign data. This authentication method uses the **JWT credential** and can use either a **Passphrase** or **PEM Key** as key type. Refer to [JWT credential](../jwt/) for more information.
