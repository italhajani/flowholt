Description: Learn how to use the Embeddings Azure OpenAI node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate Embeddings Azure OpenAI node into your workflows.
# Embeddings Azure OpenAI node[#](#embeddings-azure-openai-node "Permanent link")

Use the Embeddings Azure OpenAI node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Azure OpenAI node, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/azureopenai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

* **Model (Deployment) Name**: Select the model (deployment) to use for generating embeddings.
* **Batch Size**: Enter the maximum number of documents to send in each request.
* **Strip New Lines**: Select whether to remove new line characters from input text (turned on) or not (turned off). n8n enables this by default.
* **Timeout**: Enter the maximum amount of time a request can take in seconds. Set to `-1` for no timeout.
