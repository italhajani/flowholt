Description: Documentation for Zammad credentials. Use these credentials to authenticate Zammad in n8n, a workflow automation platform.
# Zammad credentials[#](#zammad-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Zammad](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.zammad/)

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

* Create a hosted [Zammad](https://zammad.com/) account or set up your own Zammad instance.
* For token authentication, enable **API Token Access** in **Settings > System > API**. Refer to [Setting up a Zammad](https://admin-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/system/integrations/zabbix.html?#setting-up-a-zammad) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* Basic auth
* Token auth: Zammad recommends using this authentication method.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Zammad's API Authentication documentation](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/intro.html?#authentication) for more information about authenticating with the service.

## Using basic auth[#](#using-basic-auth "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **Base URL**: Enter the URL of your Zammad instance.
* An **Email** address: Enter the email address you use to log in to Zammad.
* A **Password**: Enter your Zammad password.
* **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.

## Using token auth[#](#using-token-auth "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **Base URL**: Enter the URL of your Zammad instance.
* An **Access Token**: Once **API Token Access** is enabled for the Zammad instance, any user with the `user_preferences.access_token` permission can generate an **Access Token** by going to your **avatar > Profile > Token Access** and **Create** a new token.
  + The access token permissions depend on what actions you'd like to complete with this credential. For all functionality within the [Zammad](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.zammad/) node, select:
    - `admin.group`
    - `admin.organization`
    - `admin.user`
    - `ticket.agent`
    - `ticket.customer`
* **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.
