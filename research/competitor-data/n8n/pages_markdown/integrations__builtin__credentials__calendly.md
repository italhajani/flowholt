## Using API access token[#](#using-api-access-token "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Calendly](https://www.calendly.com/) account and:

* An API Key or **Personal Access Token**

To get your access token:

1. Go to the Calendly [**Integrations & apps**](https://calendly.com/integrations) page.
2. Select [**API & Webhooks**](https://calendly.com/integrations/api_webhooks).
3. In **Your Personal Access Tokens**, select **Generate new token**.

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Calendly developer](https://developer.calendly.com) account and:

* A **Client ID**
* A **Client Secret**

To get both, create a new OAuth app in Calendly:

1. Log in to Calendly's developer portal and go to [**My apps**](https://developer.calendly.com/console/apps).
2. Select **Create new app**.
3. Enter a **Name of app**, like `n8n integration`.
4. In **Kind of app**, select **Web**.
5. In **Environment type**, select the environment that corresponds to your usage, either **Sandbox** or **Production**.
   * Calendly recommends starting with **Sandbox** for development and creating a second application for **Production** when you're ready to go live.
6. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and enter it as a **Redirect URI** in the OAuth app.
7. Select **Save & Continue**. The app details display.
8. Copy the **Client ID** and enter this as your n8n **Client ID**.
9. Copy the **Client secret** and enter this as your n8n **Client Secret**.
10. Select **Connect my account** in n8n and follow the on-screen prompts to finish authorizing the credential.
