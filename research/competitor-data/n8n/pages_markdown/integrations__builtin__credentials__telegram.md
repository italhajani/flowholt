Refer to the [Telegram Bot Features](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features) documentation for more information on creating and working with bots.

## Using API bot access token[#](#using-api-bot-access-token "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A bot **Access Token**

To generate your access token:

1. Start a chat with the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).
2. Enter the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
3. The BotFather will ask you for a name and username for your new bot:
   * The **name** is the bot's name displayed in contact details and elsewhere. You can change the bot name later.
   * The **username** is a short name used in search, mentions, and t.me links. Use these guidelines when creating your username:
     + Must be between 5 and 32 characters long.
     + Not case sensitive.
     + May only include Latin characters, numbers, and underscores.
     + Must end in `bot`, like `tetris_bot` or `TetrisBot`.
     + You can't change the username later.
4. Copy the bot **token** the BotFather generates and add it as the **Access Token** in n8n.

Refer to the [BotFather Create a new bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#creating-a-new-bot) for more information.
