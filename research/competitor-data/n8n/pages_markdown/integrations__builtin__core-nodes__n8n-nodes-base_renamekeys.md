# Rename Keys[#](#rename-keys "Permanent link")

Use the Rename Keys node to rename the keys of a key-value pair in n8n.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

You can rename one or multiple keys using the Rename Keys node. Select the **Add new key** button to rename a key.

For each key, enter the:

* **Current Key Name**: The current name of the key you want to rename.
* **New Key Name**: The new name you want to assign to the key.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Choose whether to use a **Regex** regular expression to identify keys to rename. To use this option, you must also enter:

* The **Regular Expression** you'd like to use.
* **Replace With**: Enter the new name you want to assign to the key(s) that match the **Regular Expression**.
* You can also choose these Regex-specific options:
  + **Case Insensitive**: Set whether the regular expression should match case (turned off) or be case insensitive (turned on).
  + **Max Depth**: Enter the maximum depth to replace keys, using `-1` for unlimited and `0` for top-level only.

Regex impacts

Using a regular expression can affect any keys that match the expression, including keys you've already renamed.
