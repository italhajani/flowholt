## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Webflow's API documentation](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/rest-introduction) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token[#](#using-api-access-token "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A Site **Access Token**: Access tokens are site-specific. Go to your site's **Site Settings > Apps & integrations > API access** and select **Generate API token**. Refer to [Get a Site Token](https://developers.webflow.com/data/v1.0.0/docs/get-a-site-token) for more information.

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, [register an application](https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/register-an-app) in your workspace.

Use these settings for your application:

* Copy the **OAuth callback URL** from n8n and add it as a **Redirect URI** in your application.
* Once you've created your application, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and enter them in your n8n credential.
* If you are using the Webflow Data API V1 (deprecated), enable the **Legacy** toggle. Otherwise, leave this inactive.

Refer to [OAuth](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/oauth-app) for more information on Webflow's OAuth web flow.
