Description: View and restore previous versions of your workflow.
# Workflow history[#](#workflow-history "Permanent link")

Feature availability

* Full workflow history is available on Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Self-hosted.
* Versions from the last five days are available for Cloud Pro users.
* Versions from the last 24 hours are available for all users.

Use workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows.

## Understand workflow history[#](#understand-workflow-history "Permanent link")

n8n creates a new version when you:

* Save your workflow.
* Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.
* Pull from a Git repository using [Source control](../../source-control-environments/). Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.

Changes to workflow settings do not create a new version.

Workflow history and execution history

Don't confuse workflow history with the [Workflow-level executions list](../executions/single-workflow-executions/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](../executions/debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.

## View workflow history[#](#view-workflow-history "Permanent link")

To view a workflow's history:

1. Open the workflow.
2. Select **Workflow history** ![Workflow history icon](../../_images/common-icons/workflow-history.png). n8n opens a menu showing the saved workflow versions, and a canvas with a preview of the selected version.

## Restore or copy previous versions[#](#restore-or-copy-previous-versions "Permanent link")

You can restore a previous workflow version, or make a copy of it:

1. On the version you want to restore or copy, select **Options** ![Options icon](../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png).
2. Choose what you want to do:
   * **Restore version**: replace your current workflow with the selected version.
   * **Clone to new workflow**: create a new workflow based on the selected version.
   * **Open version in new tab**: open a second tab displaying the selected version. Use this to compare versions.
   * **Download**: download the version as JSON.
   * **Name version**: give the version a name and description. Named versions are protected from automatic pruning. Refer to [Naming versions](../publish/#naming-versions) for more details. Available on Pro and Enterprise plans.
