Description: Learn how to use the Custom Code Tool node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate Custom Code Tool node into your workflows.
# Custom Code Tool node[#](#custom-code-tool-node "Permanent link")

Use the Custom Code Tool node to write code that an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) can run.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Custom Code Tool node and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Description[#](#description "Permanent link")

Give your custom code a description. This tells the agent when to use this tool. For example:

> Call this tool to get a random color. The input should be a string with comma separated names of colors to exclude.

### Language[#](#language "Permanent link")

You can use JavaScript or Python.

### JavaScript / Python box[#](#javascript-python-box "Permanent link")

Write the code here.

You can access the tool input using `query`. For example, to take the input string and lowercase it:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` let myString = query; return myString.toLowerCase(); ``` |
