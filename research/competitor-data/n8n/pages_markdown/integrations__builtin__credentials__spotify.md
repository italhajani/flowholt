1. Open the [Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
2. Select **Create an app**.
3. Enter an **App name**, like `n8n integration`.
4. Enter an **App description**.
5. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Redirect URI** in your Spotify app.
6. Check the box to agree to the Spotify Terms of Service and Branding Guidelines.
7. Select **Create**. The **App overview** page opens.
8. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.
9. Copy the **Client Secret** and enter it in your n8n credential.
10. Select **Connect my account** and follow the on-screen prompts to finish authorizing the credential.
