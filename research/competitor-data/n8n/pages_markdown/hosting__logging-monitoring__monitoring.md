Description: Get metrics for a health check
# Monitoring[#](#monitoring "Permanent link")

There are three API endpoints you can call to check the status of your instance: `/healthz`, `healthz/readiness`, and `/metrics`.

## healthz and healthz/readiness[#](#healthz-and-healthzreadiness "Permanent link")

The `/healthz` endpoint returns a standard HTTP status code. 200 indicates the instance is reachable. It doesn't indicate DB status. It's available for both self-hosted and Cloud users.

Access the endpoint:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` <your-instance-url>/healthz ``` |

The `/healthz/readiness` endpoint is similar to the `/healthz` endpoint, but it returns a HTTP status code of 200 if the DB is connected and migrated and therefore the instance is ready to accept traffic.

Access the endpoint:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` <your-instance-url>/healthz/readiness ``` |

Customizing health check endpoints

You can customize the health check endpoint path using the [`N8N_ENDPOINT_HEALTH`](../../configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/) environment variable.

## metrics[#](#metrics "Permanent link")

The `/metrics` endpoint provides more detailed information about the current status of the instance.

Access the endpoint:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` <your-instance-url>/metrics ``` |

Feature availability

The `/metrics` endpoint isn't available on n8n Cloud.

## Enable metrics and health checks for self-hosted n8n[#](#enable-metrics-and-health-checks-for-self-hosted-n8n "Permanent link")

The `/metrics` endpoint is disabled by default. The health endpoint is always enabled on the main n8n server. For worker servers in [queue mode](../../scaling/queue-mode/), the health endpoint is disabled by default.

To enable them, configure your n8n instance:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 ``` | ``` # metrics N8N_METRICS=true # healthz QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE=true ``` |

Refer to [Configuration methods](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on how to configure your instance using environment variables.
