Description: Documentation for the Kibana credentials. Use these credentials to authenticate Kibana in n8n, a workflow automation platform.
# Kibana credentials[#](#kibana-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate when using the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to make a [Custom API call](../../../custom-operations/).

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

* Create an [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) account.
* If you're creating a new account to test with, load some sample data into Kibana. Refer to the [Kibana quick start](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/get-started.html) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* Basic auth

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Kibana's API documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api.html) for more information about the service.

This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/kibana/) on n8n's website.

## Using basic auth[#](#using-basic-auth "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* The **URL** you use to access Kibana, for example `http://localhost:5601`
* A **Username**: Use the same username that you use to log in to Elastic.
* A **Password**: Use the same password that you use to log in to Elastic.
