## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* An **Access Token URL**: Zoho provides region-specific access token URLs. Select the region that best fits your Zoho data center:
  + **AU**: Select this option for Australia data center.
  + **CN**: Select this option for Canada data center.
  + **EU**: Select this option for the European Union data center.
  + **IN**: Select this option for the India data center.
  + **US**: Select this option for the United States data center.

Refer to [Multi DC](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v3/multi-dc.html) for more information about selecting a data center.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, [register an application](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/protocol/oauth-setup.html) with Zoho.

Use these settings for your application:

* Select **Server-based Applications** as the **Client Type**.
* Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it in the Zoho **Authorized Redirect URIs** field.
* Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the application and enter them in your n8n credential.
