Description: Documentation for MQTT credentials. Use these credentials to authenticate MQTT in n8n, a workflow automation platform.
# MQTT credentials[#](#mqtt-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [MQTT](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtt/)
* [MQTT Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtttrigger/)

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

Install an [MQTT broker](https://mqtt.org/).

MQTT provides a list of Servers/Brokers at [MQTT Software](https://mqtt.org/software/).

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* Broker connection

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [MQTT's documentation](https://mqtt.org/) for more information about the MQTT protocol.

Refer to your broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration and details.

## Using broker connection[#](#using-broker-connection "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* Your MQTT broker's **Protocol**
* The **Host**
* The **Port**
* A **Username** and **Password** to authenticate with
* If you're using **SSL**, the relevant certificates and keys

To set things up:

1. Select the broker's **Protocol**, which determines the URL n8n uses. Options include:
   * **Mqtt**: Begin the URL with the standard `mqtt:` protocol.
   * **Mqtts**: Begin the URL with the secure `mqtts:` protocol.
   * **Ws**: Begin the URL with the WebSocket `ws:` protocol.
2. Enter your broker **Host**.
3. Enter the **Port** number n8n should use to connect to the broker host.
4. Enter the **Username** to log into the broker as.
5. Enter that user's **Password**.
6. If you want to receive QoS 1 and 2 messages while offline, turn off the **Clean Session** toggle.
7. Enter a **Client ID** you'd like the credential to use. If you leave this blank, n8n will generate one for you. You can use a fixed or expression-based Client ID.
   * Client IDs can be useful to identify and track connection access. n8n recommends using something with `n8n` in it for easier auditing.
8. If your MQTT broker uses SSL, turn the **SSL** toggle on. Once you turn it on:
   1. Select whether to use **Passwordless** connection with certificates, which is like the SASL mechanism EXTERNAL. If turned on:
      1. Select whether to **Reject Unauthorized Certificate**: If turned off, n8n will connect even if the certificate validation fails.
      2. Add an SSL **Client Certificate**.
      3. Add an SSL **Client Key** for the Client Certificate.
   2. One or more SSL **CA Certificates**.

Refer to your MQTT broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration instructions.
