Description: Learn how to use the Local File Trigger node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate Local File Trigger node into your workflows.
# Local File Trigger node[#](#local-file-trigger-node "Permanent link")

The Local File Trigger node starts a workflow when it detects changes on the file system. These changes involve a file or folder getting added, changed, or deleted.

Security considerations

The Local File Trigger node can introduce significant security risks in environments that operate with untrusted users. Because of this, the node is [disabled](../../../../hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/#exclude-nodes) by default starting from version 2.0.

Self-hosted n8n only

This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

You can choose what event to watch for using the **Trigger On** parameter.

## Changes to a Specific File[#](#changes-to-a-specific-file "Permanent link")

The node triggers when the specified file changes.

Enter the path for the file to watch in **File to Watch**.

## Changes Involving a Specific Folder[#](#changes-involving-a-specific-folder "Permanent link")

The node triggers when a change occurs in the selected folder.

Configure these parameters:

* **Folder to Watch**: Enter the path of the folder to watch.
* **Watch for**: Select the type of change to watch for.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Use the node **Options** to include or exclude files and folders.

* **Include Linked Files/Folders**: also watch for changes to linked files or folders.
* **Ignore**: files or paths to ignore. n8n tests the whole path, not just the filename. Supports the [Anymatch](https://github.com/micromatch/anymatch) syntax.
* **Max Folder Depth**: how deep into the folder structure to watch for changes.

### Examples for Ignore[#](#examples-for-ignore "Permanent link")

Ignore a single file:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` **/<fileName>.<suffix> # For example, **/myfile.txt ``` |

Ignore a sub-directory of a directory you're watching:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 ``` | ``` **/<directoryName>/** # For example, **/myDirectory/** ``` |
