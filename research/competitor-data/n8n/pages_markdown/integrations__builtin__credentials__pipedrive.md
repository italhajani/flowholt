Description: Documentation for Pipedrive credentials. Use these credentials to authenticate Pipedrive in n8n, a workflow automation platform.
# Pipedrive credentials[#](#pipedrive-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Pipedrive](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedrive/)
* [Pipedrive Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedrivetrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* API token
* OAuth2

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Pipedrive's developer documentation](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/getting-started) for more information about the service.

## Using API token[#](#using-api-token "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Pipedrive](https://pipedrive.com/) account and:

* An **API Token**

To get your API token:

1. Open your [**API Personal Preferences**](https://app.pipedrive.com/settings/api).
2. Copy **Your personal API token** and enter it in your n8n credential.

If you have multiple companies, you'll need to select the correct company first:

1. Select your account name and be sure you're viewing the correct company.
2. Then select **Company Settings**.
3. Select **Personal Preferences**.
4. Select the **API** tab.
5. Copy **Your personal API token** and enter it in your n8n credential.

Refer to [How to find the API token](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/how-to-find-the-api-token) for more information.

## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Pipedrive developer sandbox account](https://developers.pipedrive.com/) and:

* A **Client ID**
* A **Client Secret**

To get both, you'll need to register a new app:

1. Select your profile name in the upper right corner.
2. Find the company name of your sandbox account and select **Developer Hub**.

   No Developer Hub

   If you don't see **Developer Hub** in your account dropdown, sign up for a [developer sandbox account](https://developers.pipedrive.com/).
3. Select **Create an app**.
4. Select **Create public app**. The app's **Basic info** tab opens.
5. Enter an **App name** for your app, like `n8n integration`.
6. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add it as the app's **Callback URL**.
7. Select **Save**. The app's **OAuth & access scopes** tab opens.
8. Turn on appropriate **Scopes** for your app. Refer to [Pipedrive node scopes](#pipedrive-node-scopes) and [Pipedrive Trigger node scopes](#pipedrive-trigger-node-scopes) below for more guidance.
9. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.
10. Copy the **Client Secret** and enter it in your n8n credential.

Refer to [Registering a public app](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-registering-the-app) for more information.
