## How to control which custom fields to fetch for a user[#](#how-to-control-which-custom-fields-to-fetch-for-a-user "Permanent link")

There are three different ways to control which custom fields to retrieve when getting a user's information. Use the **Custom Fields** parameter to select one of the following:

* **Don't Include**: Doesn't include any custom fields.
* **Custom**: Includes the custom fields from schemas in **Custom Schema Names or IDs**.
* **Include All**: Include all the fields associated with the user.

To include custom fields, follow these steps:

1. Select **Custom** from the **Custom Fields** dropdown list.
2. Select the schema names you want to include in the **Custom Schema Names or IDs** dropdown list.
