Use the Microsoft OneDrive node to automate work in Microsoft OneDrive, and integrate Microsoft OneDrive with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Microsoft OneDrive features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting files, and folders.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Microsoft OneDrive node supports and links to more resources.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [Microsoft's OneDrive API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/) for more information about the service.

## Find the folder ID[#](#find-the-folder-id "Permanent link")

To perform operations on folders, you need to supply the ID. You can find this:

* In the URL of the folder
* By searching for it using the node. You need to do this if using MS 365 (where OneDrive uses SharePoint behind the scenes):
  1. Select **Resource** > **Folder**.
  2. Select **Operation** > **Search**.
  3. In **Query**, enter the folder name.
  4. Select **Execute step**. n8n runs the query and returns data about the folder, including an `id` field containing the folder ID.
