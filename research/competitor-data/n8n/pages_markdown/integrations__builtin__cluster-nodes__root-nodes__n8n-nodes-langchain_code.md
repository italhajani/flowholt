Description: Learn how to use the LangChain Code node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate LangChain Code node into your workflows.
# LangChain Code node[#](#langchain-code-node "Permanent link")

Use the LangChain Code node to import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it. By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors you can use it as a normal node, root node or sub-node.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters, guidance on configuring the node, and links to more resources.

Not available on Cloud

This node is only available on self-hosted n8n.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Add Code[#](#add-code "Permanent link")

Add your custom code. Choose either **Execute** or **Supply Data** mode. You can only use one mode.

Unlike the [Code node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/), the LangChain Code node doesn't support Python.

* **Execute**: use the LangChain Code node like n8n's own Code node. This takes input data from the workflow, processes it, and returns it as the node output. This mode requires a main input and output. You must create these connections in **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
* **Supply Data**: use the LangChain Code node as a sub-node, sending data to a root node. This uses an output other than main.

By default, you can't load built-in or external modules in this node. Self-hosted users can [enable built-in and external modules](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/).

### Inputs[#](#inputs "Permanent link")

Choose the input types.

The main input is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

### Outputs[#](#outputs "Permanent link")

Choose the output types.

The main output is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

## Node inputs and outputs configuration[#](#node-inputs-and-outputs-configuration "Permanent link")

By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors (inputs and outputs) you can use it as an app node, root node or sub-node.

| Node type | Inputs | Outputs | Code mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App node. Similar to the [Code node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/). | Main | Main | Execute |
| Root node | Main; at least one other type | Main | Execute |
| Sub-node | - | A type other than main. Must match the input type you want to connect to. | Supply Data |
| Sub-node with sub-nodes | A type other than main | A type other than main. Must match the input type you want to connect to. | Supply Data |

## Built-in methods[#](#built-in-methods "Permanent link")

n8n provides these methods to make it easier to perform common tasks in the LangChain Code node.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `this.addInputData(inputName, data)` | Populate the data of a specified non-main input. Useful for mocking data.  * `inputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore` * `data` contains the data you want to add. Refer to [Data structure](../../../../../data/data-structure/) for information on the data structure expected by n8n. |
| `this.addOutputData(outputName, data)` | Populate the data of a specified non-main output. Useful for mocking data.  * `outputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore` * `data` contains the data you want to add. Refer to [Data structure](../../../../../data/data-structure/) for information on the data structure expected by n8n. |
| `this.getInputConnectionData(inputName, itemIndex, inputIndex?)` | Get data from a specified non-main input.  * `inputName` is the input connection type, and must be one of: `ai_agent`, `ai_chain`, `ai_document`, `ai_embedding`, `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_outputParser`, `ai_retriever`, `ai_textSplitter`, `ai_tool`, `ai_vectorRetriever`, `ai_vectorStore` * `itemIndex` should always be `0` (this parameter will be used in upcoming functionality) * Use `inputIndex` if there is more than one node connected to the specified input. |
| `this.getInputData(inputIndex?, inputName?)` | Get data from the main input. |
| `this.getNode()` | Get the current node. |
| `this.getNodeOutputs()` | Get the outputs of the current node. |
| `this.getExecutionCancelSignal()` | Use this to stop the execution of a function when the workflow stops. In most cases n8n handles this, but you may need to use it if building your own chains or agents. It replaces the [Cancelling a running LLMChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/llm_chain#cancelling-a-running-llmchain) code that you'd use if building a LangChain application normally. |
