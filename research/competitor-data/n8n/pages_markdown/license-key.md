Description: How to activate your license key.
# License Key[#](#license-key "Permanent link")

To enable certain licensed features, you must first activate your license. You can do this either through the UI or by setting environment variables.

## Add a license key using the UI[#](#add-a-license-key-using-the-ui "Permanent link")

In your n8n instance:

1. Log in as **Admin** or **Owner**.
2. Select **Settings** > **Usage and plan**.
3. Select **Enter activation key**.
4. Paste in your license key.
5. Select **Activate**.

## Add a license key using an environment variables[#](#add-a-license-key-using-an-environment-variables "Permanent link")

In your n8n configuration, set `N8N_LICENSE_ACTIVATION_KEY` to your license key. If the instance already has an activated license, this variable will have no effect.

Refer to [Environment variables](../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) to learn more about configuring n8n.

## Allowlist the license server IP addresses[#](#allowlist-the-license-server-ip-addresses "Permanent link")

n8n uses Cloudflare to host the license server. As the specific IP addresses can change, you need to allowlist the [full range of Cloudflare IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) to ensure n8n can always reach the license server.
