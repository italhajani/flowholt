Description: Documentation for SurveyMonkey credentials. Use these credentials to authenticate SurveyMonkey in n8n, a workflow automation platform.
# SurveyMonkey credentials[#](#surveymonkey-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [SurveyMonkey Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.surveymonkeytrigger/)

## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

* Create a [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com) account.
* [Register an app](https://api.surveymonkey.com/v3/docs?api_key=3yr7n6m8sjwvm48x8nhxej52#registering-an-app) from your [**Developer dashboard > My apps**](https://developer.surveymonkey.com/apps/).
  + Refer to [Required app scopes](#required-app-scopes) for information on the scopes you must use.

## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods "Permanent link")

* API access token
* OAuth2

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Refer to [SurveyMonkey's API documentation](https://developer.surveymonkey.com/api/v3/#SurveyMonkey-Api) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token[#](#using-api-access-token "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* An **Access Token**: Generated once you create an app.
* A **Client ID**: Generated once you create an app.
* A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create an app.

Once you've created your app and assigned appropriate scopes, go to **Settings > Credentials**. Copy the **Access Token**, **Client ID**, and **Secret** and add them to n8n.

## Using OAuth[#](#using-oauth "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **Client ID**: Generated once you create an app.
* A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create an app.

Once you've created your app and assigned appropriate scopes:

1. Go to the app's **Settings > Settings**.
2. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**.
3. Overwrite the app's existing **OAuth Redirect URL** with that URL.
4. Select **Submit Changes**.
5. Be sure the **Scopes** section contains the [Required app scopes](#required-app-scopes).

From the app's **Settings > Credentials**, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to your n8n credential. You can now select **Connect my account** from n8n.

SurveyMonkey Test OAuth Flow

This option only works if you keep the default SurveyMonkey **OAuth Redirect URL** and add the n8n OAuth Redirect URL as an **Additional Redirect URL**.

## Required app scopes[#](#required-app-scopes "Permanent link")

Once you create your app, go to **Settings > Scopes**. Select these scopes for your n8n credential to work:

* **View Surveys**
* **View Collectors**
* **View Responses**
* **View Response Details**
* **Create/Modify Webhooks**
* **View Webhooks**

Select **Update Scopes** to save them.
