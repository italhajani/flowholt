## Using API key[#](#using-api-key "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* The API **URL**: Enter the correct domain for your API requests:
  + On US Cloud, use `https://us.i.posthog.com` for public POST-only endpoints or `https://us.posthog.com` for private endpoints.
  + On EU Cloud, use `https://eu.i.posthog.com` for public POST-only endpoints or `https://eu.posthog.com` for private endpoints.
  + For self-hosted instances, use your self-hosted domain.
  + Confirm yours by checking your PostHog instance URL.
* An **API Key**: The API key you use depends on whether you're accessing public or private endpoints:
  + For public POST-only endpoints, use a [Project API key](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) from your project's **General** Settings.
  + For private endpoints, use a [Personal API key](https://app.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys) from your User account's **Personal API Keys** Settings. Refer to [How to obtain a personal API key](https://posthog.com/docs/api#private-endpoint-authentication) for more information.
