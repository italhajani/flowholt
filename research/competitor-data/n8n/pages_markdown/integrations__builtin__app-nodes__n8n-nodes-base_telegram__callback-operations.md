This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

## Answer Query[#](#answer-query "Permanent link")

Use this operation to send answers to callback queries sent from [inline keyboards](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#inline-keyboards) using the Bot API [answerCallbackQuery](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#answercallbackquery) method.

* **Resource**: Select **Callback**.
