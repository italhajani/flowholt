## Node reference[#](#node-reference "Permanent link")

### Create a session and window[#](#create-a-session-and-window "Permanent link")

Create an Airtop browser session to get a **Session ID**, then use it to create a new browser window. After this, you can use any extraction or interaction operation.

### Extract content[#](#extract-content "Permanent link")

Extract content from a web browser using these operations:

* **Query page**: Extract information from the current window.
* **Query page with pagination**: Extract information from pages with pagination or infinite scrolling.
* **Smart scrape page**: Get the window content as markdown.

Get JSON responses by using the **JSON Output Schema** parameter in query operations.

### Interacting with pages[#](#interacting-with-pages "Permanent link")

Click, hover, or type on elements by describing the element you want to interact with.

### Terminate a session[#](#terminate-a-session "Permanent link")

End your session to save resources. Sessions are automatically terminated based on the **Idle Timeout** set in the **Create Session** operation or can be manually terminated using the **Terminate Session** operation.
