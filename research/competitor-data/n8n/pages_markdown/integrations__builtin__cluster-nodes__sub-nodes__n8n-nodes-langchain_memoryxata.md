Description: Learn how to use the Xata node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate Xata node into your workflows.
# Xata node[#](#xata-node "Permanent link")

Use the Xata node to use Xata as a [memory](../../../../../glossary/#ai-memory) server.
On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Xata node supports, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/xata/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Single memory instance[#](#single-memory-instance "Permanent link")

If you add more than one Xata node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.
