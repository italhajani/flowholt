Description: Learn how to use the OpenRouter Chat Model node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate OpenRouter Chat Model node into your workflows.
# OpenRouter Chat Model node[#](#openrouter-chat-model-node "Permanent link")

Use the OpenRouter Chat Model node to use OpenRouter's chat models with conversational agents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the OpenRouter Chat Model node and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/openrouter/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Model[#](#model "Permanent link")

Select the model to use to generate the completion.

n8n dynamically loads models from OpenRouter and you'll only see the models available to your account.

## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Use these options to further refine the node's behavior.

### Frequency Penalty[#](#frequency-penalty "Permanent link")

Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.

### Maximum Number of Tokens[#](#maximum-number-of-tokens "Permanent link")

Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.

### Response Format[#](#response-format "Permanent link")

Choose **Text** or **JSON**. **JSON** ensures the model returns valid JSON.

### Presence Penalty[#](#presence-penalty "Permanent link")

Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.

### Sampling Temperature[#](#sampling-temperature "Permanent link")

Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

### Timeout[#](#timeout "Permanent link")

Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.

### Max Retries[#](#max-retries "Permanent link")

Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.

### Top P[#](#top-p "Permanent link")

Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.
