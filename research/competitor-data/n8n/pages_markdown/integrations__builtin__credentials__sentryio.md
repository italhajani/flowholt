Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, [create an integration](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/integrations/integration-platform/#creating-an-integration) with these settings:

* Copy the n8n **OAuth Callback URL** and add it as an **Authorized Redirect URI**.
* Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to your n8n credential.

Refer to [Public integrations](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/integrations/integration-platform/public-integration/) for more information on creating the integration.

## Using Server API token[#](#using-server-api-token "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* An API **Token**: Generate a [**User Auth Token**](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) in **Account > Settings > User Auth Tokens**. Refer to [User Auth Tokens](https://docs.sentry.io/account/auth-tokens/#user-auth-tokens) for more information.
* The **URL** of your self-hosted Sentry instance.
