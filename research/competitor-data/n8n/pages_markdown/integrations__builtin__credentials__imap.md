Description: Documentation for IMAP credentials. Use these credentials to authenticate IMAP in n8n, a workflow automation platform.
# IMAP credentials[#](#imap-credentials "Permanent link")

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [IMAP Email](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.emailimap/)

* User account

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a standard protocol for receiving email. Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with IMAP; refer to your provider's IMAP instructions.

## Using user account[#](#using-user-account "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **User** name: The email address you're retrieving email for.
* A **Password**: Either the password you use to check email or an app password. Your provider will tell you whether to use your own password or to generate an app password.
* A **Host**: The IMAP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `imap.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.
* A **Port** number: The default is port `993`. Use this port unless your provider or email administrator tells you to use something different.

Choose whether to use **SSL/TLS** and whether to **Allow Self-Signed Certificates**.
