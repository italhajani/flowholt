Description: Learn how to use the Redis Chat Memory node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate Redis Chat Memory node into your workflows.
# Redis Chat Memory node[#](#redis-chat-memory-node "Permanent link")

Use the Redis Chat Memory node to use Redis as a [memory](../../../../../glossary/#ai-memory) server.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Redis Chat Memory node supports, and links to more resources.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/redis/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Session Key**: Enter the key to use to store the memory in the workflow data.
* **Session Time To Live**: Use this parameter to make the session expire after a given number of seconds.
* **Context Window Length**: Enter the number of previous interactions to consider for context.

## Single memory instance[#](#single-memory-instance "Permanent link")

If you add more than one Redis Chat Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.
