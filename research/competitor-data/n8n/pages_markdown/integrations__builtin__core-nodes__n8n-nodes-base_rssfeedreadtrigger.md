# RSS Feed Trigger node[#](#rss-feed-trigger-node "Permanent link")

The RSS Feed Trigger node allows you to start an n8n workflow when a new RSS feed item has been published.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the RSS Feed Trigger node supports, and links to more resources.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

* **Poll Times**: Select a poll **Mode** to set how often to trigger the poll. Your **Mode** selection will add or remove relevant fields. Refer to the sections below to configure the parameters for each mode type.
* **Feed URL**: Enter the URL of the RSS feed to poll.

### Every Hour mode[#](#every-hour-mode "Permanent link")

Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.

### Every Day mode[#](#every-day-mode "Permanent link")

* Enter the **Hour** of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from `0` to `23`.
* Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.

### Every Week mode[#](#every-week-mode "Permanent link")

* Enter the **Hour** of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from `0` to `23`.
* Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.
* Select the **Weekday** to trigger the poll.

### Every Month mode[#](#every-month-mode "Permanent link")

* Enter the **Hour** of the day to trigger the poll in 24-hour format, from `0` to `23`.
* Enter the **Minute** of the hour to trigger the poll, from `0` to `59`.
* Enter the **Day of the Month** to trigger the poll, from `0` to `31`.

### Every X mode[#](#every-x-mode "Permanent link")

* Enter the **Value** of measurement for how often to trigger the poll in either minutes or hours.
* Select the **Unit** for the value. Supported units are **Minutes** and **Hours**.

### Custom mode[#](#custom-mode "Permanent link")

Enter a custom **Cron Expression** to trigger the poll. Use these values and ranges:

* Seconds: `0` - `59`
* Minutes: `0` - `59`
* Hours: `0` - `23`
* Day of Month: `1` - `31`
* Months: `0` - `11` (Jan - Dec)
* Day of Week: `0` - `6` (Sun - Sat)

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru). Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Cron Expression** field in n8n.

#### Examples[#](#examples "Permanent link")

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08:30, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` 30 8 4 * * * ``` |

If you want to trigger your workflow every day at 04:08, enter the following in the **Cron Expression** field.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` 8 4 * * * ``` |

#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression[#](#why-there-are-six-asterisks-in-the-cron-expression "Permanent link")

The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

| \* | \* | \* | \* | \* | \* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| second | minute | hour | day of month | month | day of week |
