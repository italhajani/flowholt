## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

n8n provides a trigger node for Airtable. You can find the trigger node docs [here](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtabletrigger/).

Refer to [Airtable's documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) for more information about the service.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported[#](#what-to-do-if-your-operation-isnt-supported "Permanent link")

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Node reference[#](#node-reference "Permanent link")

### Get the Record ID[#](#get-the-record-id "Permanent link")

To fetch data for a particular record, you need the Record ID. There are two ways to get the Record ID.

### Create a Record ID column in Airtable[#](#create-a-record-id-column-in-airtable "Permanent link")

To create a `Record ID` column in your table, refer to this [article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids). You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Use the List operation[#](#use-the-list-operation "Permanent link")

To get the Record ID of your record, you can use the **List** operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Filter records when using the List operation[#](#filter-records-when-using-the-list-operation "Permanent link")

To filter records from your Airtable base, use the **Filter By Formula** option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization `n8n`, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Select 'List' from the **Operation** dropdown list.
2. Enter the base ID and the table name in the **Base ID** and **Table** field, respectively.
3. Click on **Add Option** and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.
4. Enter the following formula in the **Filter By Formula** field: `{Organization}='n8n'`.

Similarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization `n8n`, use the following formula: `NOT({Organization}='n8n')`.

Refer to the Airtable [documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference) to learn more about the formulas.
