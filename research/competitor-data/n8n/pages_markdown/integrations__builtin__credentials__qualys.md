# Qualys credentials[#](#qualys-credentials "Permanent link")

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

## Using basic auth[#](#using-basic-auth "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **Username**
* A **Password**
* A **Requested With** string: Enter a user description, like a user agent, or keep the default `n8n application`. This sets the required `X-Requested-With` header.
